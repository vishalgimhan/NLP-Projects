**01. Covid-19 Vaccine Sentiment Analysis**

- **Library Imports**: The notebook begins by importing various libraries for data processing, visualization, and natural language processing, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and nltk.

- **Data Preprocessing**: It includes steps to clean the text data from the dataset, such as converting text to lowercase, removing Twitter handles, hashtags, URLs, special characters, and single characters, and substituting multiple spaces with a single space.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes the nltk libraryâ€™s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to calculate sentiment scores for the tweets, which are then used to create new columns for positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of sentiments across tweets and visualizes the most common words in positive and negative tweets using word clouds.
